This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The focus of the project was mainly to learn React (with focus on useState).
Couldn't find a fun api to utilize useEffect for. Will do in a future project.
Also focus was on learning how to pass props from parent to child and then retrieve data from child to parent.
You can try it out via the Vercel link.
